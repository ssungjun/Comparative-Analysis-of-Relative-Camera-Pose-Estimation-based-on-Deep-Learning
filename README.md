# Comparative-Analysis-of-Relative-Camera-Pose-Estimation-based-on-Deep-Learning
This is the project for comparative analysis of relative camera pose estimation methods using PyTorch

This is the official implementation of the paper: 

S.J. Ahn, I.Y. Gwak and S.-W. Lee, "Relative Camera Pose Estimation Network Using Geodesic Distance Loss Function," *KSC2019*.

# Required package
- python3
- PyTorch, torchvision
- scikit-image, pandas, opencv
- tqdm
- (optional)visdom

# Getting started
  - train.py is the main training script
  - eval.py evaluates on the selected dataset
